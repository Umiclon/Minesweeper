## Minesweeper Game

Project Proposal:
- What will the application do?
  - *Minesweeper is a popular puzzle solving game from the 1960s. It involves a board with hidden mines. The goal is to clear all of the boxes without uncovering any mines. Clicking on the boxes on the board will show the number of mines in the surrounding 8 boxes.*
  
- Who will use it?
  - *This game is for anyone who wants to play a casual game.*
  
- Why is this project of interest to you?
  - *In secondary school, a couple of my friends played minesweeper so I also played with them. Personally, I really like these types of simple puzzle games that I can never get bored of. Whenever I'm sitting on the bus, I would play a game or two of minesweeper.*

the bold and italic fonts correctly but they will appear correctly on GitHub.
