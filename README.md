# Minesweeper Game

## Project Proposal:

- What will the application do?
  - *Minesweeper is a popular puzzle solving game from the 1960s. It involves a board with hidden mines. The goal is to 
  clear all the boxes without uncovering any mines. Clicking on the boxes on the board will show the number of mines 
  in the surrounding 8 boxes.*
  
- Who will use it?
  - *This game is for anyone who wants to play a casual game.*
  
- Why is this project of interest to you?
  - *In secondary school, a couple of my friends played minesweeper, so I also played with them. Personally, I really 
  enjoy these types of simple puzzle games that I can never get bored with. Whenever I'm sitting on the bus, I would 
  play a game or two of minesweeper.*
